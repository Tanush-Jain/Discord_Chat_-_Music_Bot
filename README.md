# üéµ Discord Music Bot

**Date:** Sunday, July 20, 2025, 12:59 PM IST

## Overview

**Discord Music Bot** is an advanced open-source music bot built with Python and `discord.py` (slash command/interaction version). It streams high-quality audio from YouTube and YouTube Music, providing rich controls for queued music playback within any Discord server.

### ‚ú® Why Is It Unique?

- **Full Slash Command Support:** All actions use `/` commands for seamless Discord integration and autocomplete.
- **Independent Server Queues:** Each server gets its own queue, loop state, and volume‚Äîno cross-server interference.
- **Robust Feature Set:** Includes looping (song/queue), shuffling, time-seek, lyrics search, volume, and clear command feedback.
- **Fast & Reliable:** Plays audio through `yt-dlp` and `FFmpeg` for reliable quality and performance.
- **Modern Python & Discord:** Uses discord.py 2.x's interaction API for future-proof, responsive command handling.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Invite your bot** with the `bot` and `application.commands` scopes.
2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```
    pip install -U discord.py yt-dlp PyNaCl aiohttp
    ```
3. **Insert your bot token** in the Python code (`TOKEN = "..."`).
4. **Run the bot script:**  
    ```
    python bot.py

## üìù Notes

- **FFmpeg** must be installed and available in your system path.
- **Permissions:** For full function, the bot needs "Connect", "Speak", "Embed Links", and "Send Messages".
- Command registration is automatic via the interaction API, but new commands may need a Discord client restart/refresh to appear.
